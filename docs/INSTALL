IRM 1.4.X RELEASE INSTALL INSTRCUTIONS
---------------------------------------------

SPECIAL NOTE:

Consider this version of IRM to be pre-release quality. Try it with
great care. Backups are your friend.

IRM 1.4.0 Special Information -- IMPORTANT
-----------------------------
The new frontpage allows a guest user to easily look through the FAQ and
to enter a new work request.  This works perfectly under fresh installs
(unless you decide to change the password on the guest account), but 
will not necessarily work if you are upgrading from an older version of
IRM.  To get the front page to work properly, make sure that there is a 
user named "guest" with the password "guest".


IRM 1.4.0 Special Information -- IMPORTANT
-----------------------------
The software section of IRM is undergoing major changes at this time.
Do NOT upgrade to this version of IRM if you depend on the data in 
your software tables, part of the upgrade process includes deleting 
some of the information in the software tables.  In later versions
of IRM, conversion scripts will be included in order to populate
the new style database with your information.


If Things Go Wrong
------------------

Before we start, its important that you know what to do if things
go wrong.  First, check the FAQ (in this directory), if that doesn't
help, go to the webpage, subscribe to irm-discuss, and ask there.


Requirements
------------

To run IRM, you will need the following.

- Webserver:  Apache is recomended, but others can work.  www.apache.org

- PHP: You will need PHP 4.1.x with the following functions enabled.
	+ MySQL 
	+ If you are interested in SNMP support, SNMP
	
If you are interested in SNMP support, you will also need UCD SNMP installed
ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu

If you have any problems installing any of these packages, or you 
have installed them, and IRM is just not working, I suggest trying this link:

http://www.linuxguruz.org/index.html?state=PHPTips&topic=PHP402

Many systems have packages for the above, but many of them are not
configured correctly (PHP in Apache has no MySQL support although
MySQL is installed - common on RedHat systems).  I recomend
building everything from source for a server anyway.  

Installing
----------
By now you probably have already extracted IRM by gzip and tar.  Make sure 
that everything in the IRM directory gets placed where the webserver can find 
it.  Next edit the file include/config.inc.php with your favorite text editor 
(vi, emacs, notepad, etc...).  The file is documented if you need it.  So IRM 
can always find include/config.inc.php, you will have to edit include/irm.inc.
Look for a line called '$root_path' Documentation is once again in file.

Setting up the php.ini file:

Be sure that <irm-base>/include/DBI is listed in the include_path directive
in the php.ini file.  For example, if you set the $root_path variable in 
irm.inc to /home/username/public_html/irm-1.3.0, the section could look like:


;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; Paths and Directories ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
include_path	=  "/home/username/public_html/irm-1.4.0/include/DBI:.";

<-- end of example -->

Please note the ":." section at the end of the line.  It was missing with the 
initial release of IRM 1.3.0 and it broke the include path for other php 
programs.  After the php.ini file is modified, the webserver must be restarted
for these changes to take effect.

Next Setup the Database *** This is new for versions 1.4.x ***:

New Install: Create a database named 'irm'.

Point your web browser to setup.php within your IRM install.  For example, if
you installed IRM at http://www.schoenefeld.org/irm, point your web browser
to http://www.schoenefeld.org/irm/setup.php and follow the instructions on the
page.  After you complete this step, be sure to remove the setup.php file for security reasons.

You are almost there!  Open your web browser to the irm directory, log in with 
Admin as the user and 'admin' as the password.  Next, click on the "Setup"
link at the top of the page, then click on "Configure IRM" in order
to configure IRM to suit your needs.

Upgrades:

Point your web browser to setup.php within your IRM install.  For example, if
you installed IRM at http://www.schoenefeld.org/irm, point your web browser
to http://www.schoenefeld.org/irm/setup.php and select your current IRM version
from the dropdown box.  After you complete this step, be sure to remove the setup.php file for security reasons.

You are almost there!  Open your web browser and point it to your new irm 
installation.  Log in as a user with admin privelages.  Next, click on the 
"Setup" link at the top of the page, then click on "Configure IRM" in order
to configure IRM to suit your needs.

You can always check for updates: http://irm.schoenefeld.org
